Thank you for visiting my portfolio!

this website contains several HTML pages to present my work.
the webpages are made interactive using JaveScript functions implemented thoroughly on each element wherevever necessery.

this project includes and contains vendor libraries for aos (animation on scroll), bootstrap from getbootsrtap, bootstrap icon pack, isolate-filter layout, and a swiper library.

this project is available on github. (https://github.com/codesuhan93/)

there are areas where this web portfolio can still improve.
